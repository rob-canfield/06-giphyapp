Homework 06 - App that searches and displays .gif files from the Giphy API

Welcome to the Giphy Search App!

This project was created to allow the user to search and display .gif files on the web page simply by clicking a button. The theme I decided for this project was stand-up comedy, so the buttons available when the page loads are all names of stand-up comedians. You can add new buttons by typing the name of your favorite stand-ups (or literally any other thing in the world) in the form on the left hand side of the page.

The gifs will all be displayed on the right side of the page along with their rating. Now gif rated "r" will be displayed. Only 10 gifs will be displayed at a time. 

Have fun using this app!
